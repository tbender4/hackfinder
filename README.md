# hackfinder

**hackfinder** is a Hackathon search app using the [Eventbrite API](https://www.eventbrite.com/developer/v3/).

Description: 
Hackfinder is an iOS App that will help users find nearby hackathons using Location Services, or by searching for a specific location.

This was the final group project from taking Codepath's iOS Development course during Fall 2018. Core functionality was completed to meet the presentation day's deadline. This fork has critical improvements in functionality and is a rolling continuation.

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

**As of 11/06:**

## API Endpoints

The [Eventbrite API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) is used for finding Hackathons events.

The [Google Maps API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/) is used for the map view integration.

## Considerations
- Product Pitch
  - There is no app on the App Store with a focus on finding hackathon events. 
  - The target audience is computer science students that want to attend hackathons that fits best with their schedule, the preferred distance, and preference details into gaining in the event.
  
- Key stakeholders
  - Educational facilities such as Colleges, Universites. Tech companies can recruit students from hackathons events.
  - The app with ease the opportunity to gain experience of programming under pressure, and to expanding their network with students and Tech companies. 
  
- Core flows
  - Key functions would be the Map View that can use Location Services to interactively show nearby hackathons. List View with the Filter View can work together to narrow the user's options. The Details View is to show the user more information of the hackthon they've selected to see if the event is right for them.  
  - Each user will be able to see the Default View which is the Map View with dates written on Pins by the location of every event. Gestures are used to navigate around the map or just change to List View if the user prefers.
  
- Final Demo
  - As the Map View is the default mode of the app there will be tab bar on the bottom to switch screens to List View or to Map View. From either view, the user can tap on an event to segueway it to Detail View and give more details on the event. There will be a Filter View will also be presented to demonstrate narrowing down options.
 
- Mobile features
  - Geo-location, Map features, enabling current location, and have current activity feed for hackathon events.
  
- Technical concerns
  - To have accurate location services
  - To have precise content of our activity feed
